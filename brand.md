# myTruv – Brand Guide

## 0. Brand TL;DR

**Who we’re for**  
Middle‑income, hyper‑online adults in the US (30–40, ~$50–80k household income) who:
- Already use a bank app, spreadsheets and maybe Mint/YNAB/etc.
- Spend 6+ hours online, are pretty tech‑savvy.
- Feel that “doing money right” is a second job they’re too tired for.

**What we promise**  
A **financial behavior autopilot** that:
- Works even with **fluctuating income and messy cashflow**.
- Gives **simple, low‑effort control** instead of complicated budgets.
- Reduces **guilt, chaos and overwhelm**, not just “tracks spending”.

**What makes us different**  
myTruv **doesn’t turn you into your own accountant**.  
It builds a simple system around your real life, then nudges you with **1–2 concrete steps at a time**, measured by **Truv Score** – a signal of how healthy your money system is, not how big your income is.

## 1. Brand Essence

### 1.1 Brand Idea

> **“Calm, low‑effort control over messy money.”**

The world told you to “track every dollar” and “stick to a budget”.  
Our insight: almost everyone in our target group already tried that — and still feels stressed.

**Essence:**  
myTruv turns chaotic, guilt‑ridden money management into a **simple, supportive routine** that mostly runs on autopilot.

### 1.2 Core Truths From the Research

- **Almost everyone is already “doing something”**  
  97–98% use **spreadsheets, bank apps, notes or budgeting apps**. The problem isn’t “no tools”. The problem is that all tools make the user the **bookkeeper**.

- **Income level isn’t the real driver of stress**  
  People between **$40–70k** and **$70–100k** feel almost equally anxious. More income slightly shifts from “panic” to “not great, but trying”, but doesn’t create calm.

- **Heavy‑online & advanced users are tired, not clueless**  
  65% are advanced tech users; 63% are online **6+ hours/day**. Many have tried multiple apps + Excel. They have **tool fatigue** and **cognitive overload**, not a lack of information.

- **Budgeting apps don’t fix emotions**  
  Users of Mint / RocketMoney / YNAB / Monarch / etc. are **not noticeably calmer** than others. They still report:
  - “Low‑effort control” as the biggest unmet need.
  - Impulses, avoidance, fluctuating income.

- **Shame and secrecy = maximum anxiety**  
  The most stressed people **never admit overdrafts or overspend**. People who can openly discuss mistakes or salary are **much calmer**.  
  → Our brand must be **shame‑free** and normalize “not being perfect”.

## 2. Audience

### 2.1 Primary Audience (Core Target)

**Profile**

- **Location:** US  
- **Age:** 30–40 (especially 30–35 and 36–40)
- **Income:** $40–100k household (communication sweet spot: **$50–80k**)

  - Only ~4% feel “totally on top of it”.

**Emotional state**

- Feel that **money is “chaos + guilt + fatigue”**.
- Believe “I *should* be doing more: planning, tracking, budgeting… but I’m exhausted.”
- Especially:
  - Self‑employed → **fluctuating income, constant monitoring, tax/cashflow anxiety**.
  - Full‑time → “After work I don’t have the energy to be my own CFO.”

### 2.2 Key Segments & Angles

We don’t always show these in marketing, but we design messaging with them in mind.

#### Self‑employed

- High tech proficiency, heavy tool usage.
- Biggest problems: **fluctuating income**, constant monitoring, avoidance/guilt.
- What they want:  
  > “Take daily money micromanagement off my plate. Help me feel safe, even when months look different.”

#### Full‑time employees

- Core mass segment.
- Problems: low‑effort control, emotional fatigue, some impulsive spending and avoidance.
- What they want:  
  > “After work, I want to feel like an adult about money without becoming a finance nerd.”

#### Heavy‑online advanced users (Android/Windows skew)

- 6+ hours online, multiple tools, lots of experiment history.
- Pain: **overwhelm**, tool fatigue, diminishing returns from new dashboards.
- What they want:  
  > “Not another dashboard. A smart layer that just tells me what to do next.”

#### Intermediate users (more iOS, 1–4h online)

- Less into complex UI, more into **clear, simple steps**.
- Pain: impulsive spending, overwhelm, fluctuating income.
- What they want:  
  > “One simple score. One simple action. No jargon.”

#### Gender nuances

- All “very stressed” respondents are women.  
  → We must be **extra careful with shame or judgment** in tone.
- Women: more “I’m in a fire”; Men: more avoidance / “I’d rather not look”.

Brand response:
- **For women:** emotional safety, no red sirens, a sense of being on their side.  
- **For men:** remove friction and mental load; “We’ll watch it for you and ping you when it matters.”

## 5. Product Narrative & Features (Brand View)

### 5.1 What myTruv Feels Like

**Not**: a budgeting spreadsheet with extra steps.  
**Instead**: a **health dashboard for your money system**.

When you log in, you see:

1. **Truv Score** – your money system health (not your income level).
2. **Short diagnosis** – in plain language:
   - “You’re okay as long as you don’t add new subscriptions this month.”
   - “You’re close to your safe zone for groceries. One small adjustment keeps you on track.”
3. **1–3 next steps** – clear, doable actions:
   - “Today, move $20 to your safety cushion.”
   - “Pause one delivery app this week.”
   - “Pay $30 extra to this card to avoid interest.”

Everything else is secondary.

- “You see which ‘future punches’ you’re already covered for, and which ones still need padding.”

**Behavior autopilot**

## 6. Voice & Tone

### 6.1 Personality

- **Calm, steady, supportive** – we’re the grown‑up friend who’s got your back.
- **Honest and direct** – we acknowledge inflation, housing, medical costs, and low income realities.
- **Non‑judgmental** – no shaming, no moralizing.
- **Practical** – always focused on the next small, concrete step.
- **Tech‑comfortable but human** – we can mention “automation” and “systems”, but we speak like a real person, not an API.

### 6.2 Voice Principles

1. **Normalize the problem**
   - “It’s normal to feel like money is a bit chaotic.”
   - “Most people were never really taught how to do this.”

2. **Shrink the task**
   - “You don’t need a new 20‑page budget. Let’s start with one habit this week.”
   - “Today’s win can be as small as moving $10 to the right place.”

3. **Remove shame**
   - “You’re not alone in this.”
   - “Bad days happen. What matters is the next tiny correction.”

4. **Highlight agency without blame**
   - “We can’t change rent or healthcare costs. We can change how protected you are against them.”
   - “We can’t magically raise your income, but we can make every dollar work harder for you.”

5. **Celebrate progress**
   - “You just protected Future You from $120 in fees this year.”
   - “Your cushion is now one paycheck thicker than a month ago.”

### 6.3 Do & Don’t (Copy Examples)

**DO**

- “You’re close to your safe zone for this month’s eating out. One small adjustment keeps you in the green.”
- “You’ve been consistent for 9 days. That’s how real change looks.”
- “This week, your money system got you through a surprise bill without panic. That’s what we’re building towards.”

**DON’T**

- “You overspent again on restaurants.”
- “You failed to stick to your budget.”
- “You’re bad at controlling your impulses.”

Rewrite “don’t” into “do”:

- ❌ “You overspent again on delivery this week.”  
  ✅ “Delivery has been creeping up. Skip just one order this week and your cushion stays on track.”

- ❌ “Stop making bad choices with your credit card.”  
  ✅ “Your credit card is doing more heavy lifting than usual. One extra payment now prevents interest from snowballing.”

## 7. Social & Community

### 7.1 What We Encourage People to Share

Because openness → less anxiety, but people hate sharing raw numbers.

We **do encourage** sharing:

- Truv Score progress (e.g. 47 → 63).
- Streaks (“14 days in the green zone”).
- Rings completed (“Safety ring closed 5 times this week”).
- Behavioral wins (“Cancelled 3 useless subscriptions”, “Built my first one‑month cushion”).

We **don’t require** sharing:

- Income.
- Account balances.
- Exact spending per category.

### 7.2 Social Copy Framing

- “Share your streaks and wins, not your salary.”
- “Flex your system, not your bank balance.”
- “The only number your friends see is how consistent you are.”

---

## 8. Boundaries & Honesty

We are **not**:

- A magic income booster.
- A replacement for a job, raise, or systemic change.
- A financial education course with lectures and exams.

We **are**:

- A system that makes your existing income **more resilient** and **less chaotic**.
- A way to **squeeze more safety and calm** out of the money you already earn.
- A supportive layer that keeps you moving, even when life is noisy.

Example honest copy:

- “We can’t fix rent or healthcare prices. We can help you build a cushion so they don’t knock you over.”
- “We can’t promise you’ll never feel stressed about money. We can promise you won’t face it alone or blind.”
