   - “Budgeting apps exhaust me.”
   - “I have irregular income.”
   - “I feel anxious about money.”
   - “I don’t know what my trip/move actually cost.”

2. **Tie every topic back to our promise**  
   - no‑hustle,
   - one score & one scroll,
   - AI autopilot,
   - shame‑free.

3. **Avoid clickbait and guilt**  
   - No “Fix your bad money habits” headlines.
   - Focus on *relief*, *clarity*, *small steps*.
