# myTruv — Messaging (No‑Hustle Autopilot & One‑Score)


## Core One‑liner


> **“No‑hustle financial autopilot: one score, one scroll, and a couple of simple steps to keep your money on track — even when income is messy.”**


Alt:


> **“See your money in one calm score and a few clear actions — and finally breathe out.”**


---


## Core Narrative (Boss‑Aligned)


1. **Problem (as users feel it)**  
   - “I don’t want to live inside a budgeting app.”  
   - “I’m not going to update spreadsheets forever.”  
   - “My income and expenses change every month — budgets never really stick.”  
   - “Every time I open a money app, I end up feeling guilty.”  


2. **Insight**  
   - People don’t want more tools or discipline challenges.
   - They want:
     - a **quick read** on their money,
     - a **sense of direction** (am I drifting up or down?),
     - a few **simple moves** that make a difference,
     - and to **stop feeling bad** every time they check their accounts.  


3. **Solution**  
   - Connect your bank accounts and cards once.  
   - myTruv runs in the background and turns your real‑life cashflow into:
     - **one financial wellbeing score** that changes gradually,
     - a **one‑scroll overview** of balances, cushions and trends,
     - **1–3 simple, plain‑language actions** based on what’s actually happening.  


4. **Outcome**  
   - “Okay, that’s how much the Spain trip cost. I can see how it affected my score, and what to tweak next. It’s fine. Life goes on.”  
   - You get **just enough clarity and guidance to relax**, not enough noise to be overwhelmed.

## Key Messages


### 1. No‑hustle financial autopilot


- “You don’t need to ‘do your finances’ every day.”
- “myTruv is designed to be **checked, not worked in**.”
- “It quietly watches your patterns, then surfaces a few **high‑leverage actions** when they matter.”
- “Open, scroll once, see your status and 1–2 next steps — then get back to your life.”


### 2. One score you can trust


- “Think of it like a credit score, but for your **overall money system**, not just your debt.”
- “Your Truv Score moves **gradually**, based on real patterns — not random daily noise.”
- “Most days, it simply tells you:  
  **‘You’re okay.’**  
  or  
  **‘This month is tighter — here’s how to stay safe.’**”


### 3. One scroll, clear picture & actions


- “When you open myTruv, you don’t land in a maze of tabs.”
- On one scroll you see:
  - your **Truv Score**,
  - your **total balances & safety cushions**,
  - key **cashflow trends** (even with irregular income),
  - **1–3 short insights and suggested actions**.
- “No hunting for the ‘real’ answer across 10 dashboards.”


### 4. Stories, not spreadsheets


- “We spent a week and a half in Spain — how much did it actually cost? And did it break anything?”
- You don’t have to build trip spreadsheets or dig through statements.
- myTruv:
  - groups related transactions into **events** (trips, big purchases, weird months),
  - shows the **total and main drivers**,
  - gives a **calm verdict**:
    - “This was a normal‑sized expense for you.”
    - “This is why this month looks different.”
    - “You’re still in a healthy range, here’s what to watch.”


### 5. Calm, long‑horizon feedback


- No “close your rings by midnight or you failed your money today.”
- We care about **weeks and months**, not individual days.
- Example messaging:
  - “Over the last 30 days, your balances are slightly up. Nice job.”
  - “This quarter, delivery and takeout have crept up. You’re still okay, but that’s the main thing pulling your score down.”
- If we show streaks or rings, they’re **celebrations of consistency**, not punishments for missing a day.

## JTBD‑Based Messages (Reframed)


### Low‑effort control


> “Help me understand where I stand with money  
> without giving me a second job.”


**Message:**  

- “myTruv gives you a simple status in one place:  
  **‘Here’s your score. Here’s the trend. Here’s what changed and what to do about it.’**  
  No manual budgeting, no category gardening.”


---


### Fluctuating income


> “Budgets don’t work when every month is different. I just want to know if I’m still okay.”


**Message:**  

- “myTruv **smooths your ups and downs** into a clear picture:
  - are you drifting up or down over the last few weeks,
  - which events and habits are driving it,
  - and whether this is a one‑off spike or a real pattern.”
- “Even if your income is irregular, your **Truv Score stays interpretable**:
  - ‘You’re within your safe zone.’  
  - ‘You’re using more cushion than usual — here’s a small adjustment to protect yourself.’”


---


### Anxiety / guilt / avoidance


> “Money stresses me out and I don’t want to feel judged by an app.”


**Message:**  

- “myTruv never shames you.”
- “We talk to you the way a kind, practical friend would:
  - ‘Here’s what happened.’
  - ‘Here’s why it’s understandable.’
  - ‘Here’s one thing you can do next.’”
- “Bad months don’t trigger red alarms — they trigger **context and gentle guidance**.”


---


### Impulse / emotional spending


> “Sometimes I spend more when I’m stressed — I just want to know if that’s a problem or still safe.”


**Message:**  

- “myTruv sees the bump and adjusts your score a bit, then explains it in plain language:
  - ‘You spent more on food delivery this month.’
  - ‘Right now you’re still in a safe range, but if this keeps going, it will start to pull your score down.’”
- “You don’t get told to ‘fix yourself’ — you get one or two **concrete options**:
  - ‘Skip one order this week and your score will stabilize.’
  - ‘Move $25 from checking into your cushion to offset this month’s bump.’”


---


## Example “Spain Vacation” Messaging


- “You spent **$2,130** during your 11 days in Spain.”
- “Most of that went to **accommodation and food**; flights were a one‑time spike.”
- “Relative to your usual monthly income, this is a **manageable trip** for you.”
- “Your Truv Score dipped slightly this month, but you’re still in a healthy range.”
- “If you keep the next 4–6 weeks a bit lighter on extras, your score will bounce back to where it was.”


Tone goal:  
👉 **“Nice trip. Here’s the price tag. Here’s how to stay safe. You’re okay.”**

## What We *Don’t* Say


- “Close your financial rings daily or you failed.”
- “You blew your budget again.”
- “You’re bad with money.”
- “Track every dollar or it won’t work.”


Instead we say:


- “This month was heavier on big purchases. Your score dipped a bit — nothing dramatic, just something to keep an eye on.”
- “You had a quiet month. Your score ticked up — you’ve added a bit more protection.”
- “Your delivery spending has crept up. You’re still okay; skipping one or two orders this week keeps your score stable.”
- “You had a rough week. That happens. Here’s one simple action to feel safer by next week.”
